POC on Lightning Communities 
1)	Below is what we need to achieve using two different approaches
•	Visualforce Page 
•	Lightning Component
 	You can use contact object as source for this grid. 
a)	Approve – Send an email to contact using email template & workflow (Hi {Name} , Your request has been approved.)
b)	Reject – Open a modal window so that user should be able to add the reason for rejection. Note should be saved in note object.
 This widget will appear on community.
2)	 As a community user I should be able to upload file (only pdf) from community. Add upload button on this view.
3)	As a user I should be able to register myself as community user. (Use out of the box community registration)
4)	As community user I should have be able to login (Use out of the box form)
5)	Now filter the Contact display on the Home page with the same account name as the Community User’s Account.
